            <br>
            <p>
            The FundMore.ai team is passionate about mortgage lending because we’ve spent years in this industry.
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s our goal to create a platform that lets you provide a seamless mortgage lending experience
            that is personalized for both lenders and borrowers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Getting a mortgage approval is a stressful process for everyone involved. Private lenders are
            often exposed to additional risk – making it that much more important to get it right.</p>

            systems that make lenders more accurate and efficient.</li><br>
            <li>We’re making it easier than ever for your clients to get their mortgage approval.</li><br>
            <li>We’re working hard to make the private mortgage industry more available and more accessible to everyone involved.</li>
